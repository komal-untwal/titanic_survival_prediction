## Machine Learning project on Classification: Titanic Survival Prediction using R.

The dataset used for this project is synthetic but based on a real dataset (Titanic data) and generated using a CTGAN.(source: kaggle.com)

● The goal of the project is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the synthetic Titanic dataset or not. For each PassengerId row in the
test set, I've to predicted a 0 or 1 value to get the Survived target.
● The score obtained is in the percentage of passengers correctly predicted(as per the kaggle expected data) in terms of accuracy of model.

#### Model used:
● Random Forest Classifier.

● K-fold Cross Validation.
